16th October 2023

### Project Title
Udacity-Bikeshare-Project

### Description
Use Python to explore data related to bikeshare systems for three major systems in the US. The data will need to be munged into shape before being analyzed using descriptive statistics before being visualised.

The purpose of this taask to to continue to become familliar with the data analysis process.

This process will be done using a Jupyter Notebook.
The code should run w/o errors.
Appropriate use of
data structures/types
loops/conditional statements
Packages
functions
coding practices (i.e. Docstrings, comments, variable names & general readability)
Analysis
Pose two questions about the data
Inspect the structure of the original data (very important)
Clean the data
Answer questions about the data using descriptive statistics
Visualize the data (instead of using plt use seaborn or ggplot)
Perform additional exploratory analysis
Consider where data analysis can be applied to other fields
